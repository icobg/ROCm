# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hipSPARSE: hipSPARSE (rocSPARSE marshalling library.)
hipSPARSE:
hipSPARSE: hipSPARSE is a SPARSE marshalling library with multiple supported
hipSPARSE: backends. It sits between your application and a worker SPARSE
hipSPARSE: library, where it marshals inputs to the backend library and marshals
hipSPARSE: results to your application. hipSPARSE exports an interface that
hipSPARSE: does not require the client to change, regardless of the chosen
hipSPARSE: backend. Currently, hipSPARSE supports rocSPARSE and cuSPARSE
hipSPARSE: backends.
