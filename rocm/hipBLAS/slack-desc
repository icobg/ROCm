# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hipBLAS:
hipBLAS: hipBLAS is a Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) marshalling
hipBLAS: library with multiple supported backends. It sits between your 
hipBLAS: application and a worker BLAS library, where it marshals inputs to
hipBLAS: the backend library and marshals results to your application. hipBLAS
hipBLAS: exports an interface that doesnt require the client to change,
hipBLAS: regardless of the chosen backend. Currently, hipBLAS supports rocBLAS
hipBLAS: and cuBLAS backends.
