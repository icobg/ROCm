# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hipSPARSELt: hipSPARSELt
hipSPARSELt:
hipSPARSELt: hipSPARSELt is a SPARSE marshalling library with multiple supported
hipSPARSELt: backends. It sits between your application and a worker SPARSE
hipSPARSELt: library, where it marshals inputs to the backend library and marshals
hipSPARSELt: results to your application. hipSPARSELt exports an interface that
hipSPARSELt: does not require the client to change, regardless of the chosen
hipSPARSELt: backend. Currently, hipSPARSELt supports rocSPARSE and cuSPARSE
hipSPARSELt: backends.
