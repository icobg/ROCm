# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hipSOLVER: hipSOLVER (rocSOLVER marshalling library.)
hipSOLVER:
hipSOLVER: hipSOLVER is a LAPACK marshalling library, with multiple supported 
hipSOLVER: backends. It sits between the application and a worker LAPACK
hipSOLVER: library, marshalling inputs into the backend library and marshalling
hipSOLVER: results back to the application. hipSOLVER exports an interface that
hipSOLVER: does not require the client to change, regardless of the chosen
hipSOLVER: backend. Currently, hipSOLVER supports rocSOLVER and cuSOLVER as
hipSOLVER: backends.
